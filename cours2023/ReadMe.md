# Cours 2023

These notebooks are inspired by the 2023 lectures. 

Notice that the `Data4CoursSMallat` directory include material for some notebooks 
- the `wave.npy` sound track is used in the `wavelet1D` nb. 
- the `turbulence.png` image is used in the `gaussian_vs_turbulent_fow` nb.
- some .npy and image files for `TextureSynthesis` and `StatComponentSeparation` nbs.

To run on Google Collab (not just whatch) you have to connect to your 'MyDrive' and upload the directory.
